Non-Blocking first GitHub Enterprise (v3.15) client, this is a read only sub split, see [`github-root`](https://github.com/php-api-clients/github-root) for the root package.

## Usage

```php
use React\Http\Browser;
use ApiClients\Client\GitHubEnterprise\BearerToken;
use ApiClients\Client\GitHubEnterprise\Client;

use function React\Async\async;

$client = new Client(new BearerToken('YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'), new Browser());

// The client is using react/async internally to provide a non-promise API.
// As such you're expected to use it inside a fiber, the async call here is
// added to demonstrate and documented that requirement. The rest of the
// examples assume you have already wrapped in a fiber 0 or more levels up
// in your code such as a command bus executer or your HTTP server.
async(static function () {
    // Make API calls using the call method
    $client->call('METHOD /path/to/{the}/operation', ['array' => 'with', 'paramters' => 'for', 'the' => 'operation']);
    // Make API calls using the operations objects
    $client->operations()->group()->operation(array: 'with', paramters: 'for', the: 'operation');
})();
